## What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
A pseudo-class is a special state of an element, such as when it is hovered over or focused. Hovering is probably one of the more common usages, especially with buttons.

## What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
Specificity determines the order in which CSS styling is appplied. Higher specificity is applied later. Specificty helps know exactly which values will be applied for a property.

## What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
Multiple conflicting !important tags would defeat the purpose of the tag. It would also make it more difficult to debug issues.
