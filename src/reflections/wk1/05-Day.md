# Day 5

This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. 
Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, 
identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point 
in the course.

This week, I learned how to manage a repository on GitHub, many aspects of CSS, and Bootstrap's row and column formatting. I'm glad that I'm taking this course, we're covering exactly what I wanted to learn.
