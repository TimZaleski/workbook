# Day 4

## What is the purpose of wire-framing?
Wire framing assists in depicting page structure and layout, as well as intended user behavior. The process of wire-framing allows stakeholders and customers to get a visualization of the UI before development is started.

## What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
There are low, mid, and high fidelity wire-frames. They depict increasing levels of detail, which become more useful the further in the design process.

## Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
Low fidelty wire-frames have the highest value in that they can depict a concept in the least amount of time taken by the developer. They are the conversation starters, and have the biggest impact on decision points.
