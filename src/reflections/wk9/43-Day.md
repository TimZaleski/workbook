# Day 43

## What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
Enums allow you to give names to certain values. Some Enum examples could be days of the week (Sunday 0, Monday 1 etc), report options(!).

## How can you modify an Enum?
You can set the value of an enum. You can also change any member of an enum to a valid value for it's base type.

## How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could) 
I think I did in a side project during class, when I used a dice roller for non-numeric result dice.
