# Day 43

## How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?
You need to reduce the traditional amount and length of scrum meetings to salvage your time that the development team has to work. Small teams need to manage their communication more effectively.

## Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time?
Having multiple sprints run in parallel makes time time management aspect of scrum extremely difficult. Having one sprint be dependent on another's timeline is not a flexible strategy.

## What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?
The unattainable triangle is that you are allowed two from this list: good, cheap, and fast. Scrum can help you prioritize which of these principles to emphasize on your project.
