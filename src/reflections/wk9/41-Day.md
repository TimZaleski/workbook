# Day 41

## What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
We are hosting a server and using third party apis (for images). We're using Vue as a front end framework.

## What went well so far?
Once we got our project solidified, we had a structured timeline. We had daily goals on specific hour marks. We had a pretty good division of labor.

## What would you do differently? Why?
I would have doubled down on the importance of testing before merging before we started. Should have probably spent a little more time going over the finer details of the application.
