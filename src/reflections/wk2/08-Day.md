# Day 8

## What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style?
Console.log writes information to the console. Console.error writes error messages in red.

## Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
The Elements tab lets you see the breakdown of HTML and CSS. You can modify it directly and get instant results in your browser, so you can debug quickly.

## Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way of debugging your code?
There is a debugging pane where you can set up breakpoints and step through your code line by line. This lets you know exactly what the state is at each point.
