# Day 6

## What is scope?
Scope is the range at which a variable is accessible. A variable can't be accessed outside of it's scope.

## What is hoisting?
Hoisting has to be the grossest thing I've ever seen in my life. It apparently lets instantiate your variables after using them.

## In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
Const would be used when you need the same, never changing value repeatedly. Var would be used for globally scoped variables, and let should probably be used for everything else.
