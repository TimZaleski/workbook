# Day 39

## What are the three types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
The three types of testing are unit, component, and end-to-end testing. Unit testing allows testing on individual pieces of code in isolation. Component testing tests components in the DOM. End-to-end testing is application wide, from front to back end.

## What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
Unit testing is probably the most useful. It provides a very detailed approach to pinpoint exactly where an issue is occuring. 

## What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
I would guess component testing of the three. I honestly couldn't give a reason.
