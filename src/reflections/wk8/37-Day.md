## Why is communication on a small team important?
Streamlined communication can reduce meetings and other disruptions that have a high impact on a small team. It's important to keep each individual on the same page, because each person has a greater impact on a small team.

## What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile method effectively on a small team?
You need to reduce your meeting count to avoid disruptions. Constant communication is a good replacement via chat apps.

## What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?
The unattainable triangle is the idea that between Good, Cheap, and Fast, only two can be chosen. Fast and good won't be cheap, cheap and good won't be fast, and fast and cheap won't be good.
