# Day 12

## What is the purpose of Encapsulation?
Encapsulation keeps the data and methods you want to be private from being exposed from outside their bundle.

## What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?
If some developers aren't aware of the underscore prefic, it defeats the purpose. If you use encapsulation, you don't have to worry about that.

## How do we create private variables in in a ES6 class? Why would you do this?
Use a # prefix. Use if it you don't want your variable to be exposed.
