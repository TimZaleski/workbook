Get and Set will be set in the handler.

## What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to insure the value does not become undefined?
Return the value.

## What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?
You can use proxy objects to prevent access to certain things, kind of like creating a private variable.
