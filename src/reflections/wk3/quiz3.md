# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern

**1.** What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The four pillars are abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
```
**2.** How would you access the `name` of the below object using the `property` variable?
```js
let staff = {
  name: "Tim",
  age: 26,
  job: "Code Monkey"
  }
let property = 'name'
```
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
staff[property]
```
**3.** What is Encapsulation?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Encapsulation bundles data and methods that work together. It also hides the internal state of an object from the outside.
```
**4.** What does the S stand for in the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The S stands for Single-responsibility principle, which means a class should have one responsibility for the application.
```
**5.** What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A class is more of just a template, and a instance of a class has used that template to create something in memory.
```
**6.** What is a `Proxy` object?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A proxy object provides custom functionality to existing object functions. IE When I "get" an object, do this other thing as well.
```

**7.** What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The MVC pattern separates an application's functions into different sections.
```
**8.** What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The controller is the connection between the user input and the application logic.
```

**9.** What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Our services manage the data in the Proxy state and handle the logic of the application.
```
**10.** What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The model holds data. The model is "stupid" and contains no logic.
```
