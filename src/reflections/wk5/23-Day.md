# Day 23

## In simple terms, what is a sub-document?
A sub-document is a document that is nested in another document.

## When might you use a sub-document?
When you want to store an object inside of another object in MongoDB.

## How do you add to a collection of sub-documents? What about editing them?
You can use "findOne" to get the document. Then you get, change and save the array. If you want to edit a single sub-document, just access it like every other object.
