# Day 46

## What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
The categories are value, reference, and pointer. A value type hold it's data in it's own memory space. A reference type stores the address of where the data is stored. A pointer type is different because I will never need to use it.

## What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
bool
 byte
 char
 decimal
 double
 enum
 float
 int
 long
 sbyte
 short
 struct
 uint
 ulong
 ushort

 The types in C# can be more specific with their sizing, especially number types.

## In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
The value of a reference type is it's address in memory. That address holds the data value.
