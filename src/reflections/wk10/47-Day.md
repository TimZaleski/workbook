# Day 47

## What is a List in C#?
List is a generic type that acts as a container for any type. Lists are similar to JS arrays.

## What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?
List.Add, List.Contains, List.Find, List.Insert, and List.Sort are probably the methods that I would use most often. Those are the most ubiquitous storing and retrieving methods. 

## How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?
You could use List[index] to retrieve an item at a known index. List.Find returns the first occurance of an item matching the predicate.
