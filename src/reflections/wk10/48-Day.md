# Day 48

## What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
Enums allow you to assign "symbolic" names to values. Some examples of enums are days of the week, directions, and report types from a drop down list!

## How can you modify an Enum?
You can change the base type of an enum. You can also set default values for enum members.

## How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
I have used enums as part of a whiteboard challenge where we determined which way a person was facing. I have also used them for tying report and chart types to a number.
