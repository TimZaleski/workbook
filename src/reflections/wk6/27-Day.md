## What are props?
Props are variables and information passed between components. They are read-only, and can only be passed downward to descendants.

## What are props used for?
Props are used in a similar way to an HTML attribute
 <Component
	prop="value"

in that case to pass a string, or a v-bind to pass a javascript expression. They are used to pass information between components.

## Where can props be used or accessed?
Props can be used anywhere in the component's definition. Examples are watchers, lifecycle hooks, methods, and computed props.
