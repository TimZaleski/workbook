# Day 26

## What is Component based architecture?
Components are modualrized pieces of a user interface. They act independently of each other, which their own APIs and functions.

## What are some benefits of Component based architecture?
Performance is enhanced because the entire page is not needed to be refreshed on an update, only individual components. In the code, it is easier to determine which APIs and functions belong to certain components because they are all grouped together.

## What are some drawbacks of Component based architecture?
There is potential that readability takes a hit. It can lead to "bloated" views.
