# Day 28

## What are lifecycle hooks?
Lifecycle hooks represent different states of vue components. They range from creation to destruction of the component.

## What are lifecycle hooks used for?
Lifecycle hooks let you interact with your component. Some are client side for updating the DOM, and some are server side for data manipulation.

## What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?
Mounting hooks allow you to access your component right before and after the first render. They are used for client side DOM rendering and do not run during server side rendering.
