# Day 34

## Which principles from this week's reading did you implement?
This week, we utilized pair programming. Code documentation required more time than we were willing to commit.

## What went well?
We covered each other's knowledge gaps with paired programming. It resulted in a robust, performant application.

## What would you do differently?
The velocity in paired programming isn't the highest. We ran out of time for stretch goals. I think we could have mapped out which parts benefit from pair programming the most, and only done it for those parts.
